# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO: Sims 4 Snowboarder Career Mod.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO: A mod that adds a career to the game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO: This is mod will add a career to the game. I think I will make two mods with this feature depending on how challenging it will be. The first mod I am definitely making is a snowboarder career. There will be multiple levels to this career for the sims to complete. The Sims 4 has its on mod constructer that uses python so I will be using that.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO: I will accomplish one mod for the Sims 4

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO: I will be able to create two different mods with two different careers.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO: I will create two mods.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO: I will need to research what specific programs people use to create mods for The Sims. I will need to download a specific application called sims 4 mod constucter. I also will need to download an XML Injector. Additionally, I need to research how files and mods work in The Sims. I am also going to need to test it on a new save file in my Sims game just to make sure things are working properly. I will probably need to be better at troubleshooting issues that may arise.
